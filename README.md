Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a game of chance that is an extended version of the traditional game Rock, Paper, Scissors. This extended version increases the choices from three to five options. This game was first seen in the television show The Big Bang Theory where two of the main characters, Sheldon and Raj, use this to settle a dispute in deciding what to watch on television.
This game is a brilliant decision maker for families, friends and colleagues and the benefit of playing against the computer is that the results of your opponent are completely random and therefore are always impartial and unpredictable.

The options area consists of an instruction to tell the user to make a choice from the five interactive buttons as their options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock. These interactive buttons allow them to be selected by a user to confirm their choice.
These buttons are also interactive that the border on these buttons when hovered over increases in size making it very clear for the user to see which option they are considering.

Game Choices
When the user selects their option it is displayed as a choice below the buttons with a label saying My Choice:.
As a result of the user selecting their option the JavsScript Code has been programmed to display a computer choice. This was done by generating a random number between 1 and 5 and assigning the values from 1 to 5 to each of these options. The computer choice is displayed simultaneously with the users choice.
By displaying both the users choice and computer choice it is very clear to the user who has chosen what option.

Game Results
Below the choices there is a Result area. This area displays the winner of the game.
The JavaScript code has been programmed with an event listener so that at the same time the user selects their option, their choice and the computer choice displays and the result of who won the game displays in an understandable format, for example, 'Lizard poisions Spock'. Each potential user and computer choice has been assigned so that a result displays for every choice including if both the user and computer select the same option.
